The Crumble has connections for two DC motors. The bottom pair of terminals on the left for 'motor 1' and on the right for 'motor 2'.

Choose which motor input you want to connect to.

Connect one end of a crocodile clip the negative motor terminal (-). It is the terminal right at the bottom of the Crumble. Connect the other end of the croc clip to the negaive terminal of the DC motor. Again, this is usually marked with a '-' but if it is not clear which is the positive terminal, don't worry, just connect it to one of the two terminals.

Next, connect another croc clip from the Crumble's positive motor terminal (+) to the positive terminal of the motor.

I have used red and black crocodile clips to make things clear, but any colours will work fine.

The Crumble has connections for two DC motors: the bottom pair of terminals on the left for 'motor 1', and on the right for 'motor 2'.

You can choose either motor input for connecting your motor.

Take a crocodile clip cable and connect one of its clips to the negative motor terminal (**-**) at the bottom of the Crumble. Connect the other clip to the negative terminal of the DC motor. The motor's negative terminal should also be marked with a **-**. If you cannot see a **-**, then connect the clip to either terminal.

Connect another crocodile clip cable to the Crumble's positive motor terminal (**+**) and the positive terminal of the DC motor.

I have used red and black crocodile clip cables, but cables of any colour work correctly.

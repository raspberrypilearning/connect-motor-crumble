The Crumble board's motor connections are the two terminals at the bottom end of the board on either side.

Connect one end of a crocodile clip the Motor 1 positive terminal (+). It is the second terminal up on the left side of the board. Connect the other end of the croc clip to the posive terminal of the DC motor. Again, this is usually marked with a '+' but if it is not clear which is the positive terminal, don't worry, just connect it to one of the two terminals.

Next, connect another croc clip from the Motor 1 negative terminal (-) to the negative terminal of the motor.

I have used red and black crocodile clips to make things clear, but any colours will work fine.
